# Gesture_Control
A DIY project that uses hand gestures to control a robotic car using an accelerometer (like MPU6050) and Arduino. The system captures hand movements and translates them into directional commands (forward, backward, left, right) wirelessly via RF or Bluetooth modules. Perfect for robotics and embedded systems enthusiasts!
